#' Screen within a reference sequence the presence of a querry sequence
#'
#' With this function, the user provides a reference sequence and a querry sequence and the function compute the percentage of the reference which is covered by the querry. This computation is computed using the GenomicRanges Bioconductor objects.
#'
#'
#' @param subject The path of the reference sequence that you want to screen. The sequence should be a .fasta file including one or several sequences
#' @param querry The path of the querry sequence. he sequence should be a .fasta file including one or several sequences
#' @param pc_id_treshold the minimum percentage of identity obtained with Blast that should be obtained in order to consider that the query match the reference sequence
#' @param path the directory where Blastn is located
#'
#' @return numeric value of the percentage of the reference sequence which is covered by the querry sequence.
